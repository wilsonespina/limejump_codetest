# Limejump Code Test Submission

Submission of Front End test by Wilson Espina


## Deploying the code


### PART 1

1. From Terminal CLI, `cd` into `part_1` project folder
2. run `mongod`
3. `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependancies
4. Run `node db/seeds` to seed company data
4. Run `gulp` to view in browser


### PART 2

1. `cd` into `part_2` project folder
2. `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependancies
3. run `node.js`
4. Open `localhost:3000` in the browser to view chart


### Caveat for part 2:

The code test for part 2 was slightly beyond my current coding capability so I was unable to render the chart with Angular. Instead, I've found another GitHub Repository which I have adapted and used jQuery and vanilla JavaScript to load in stock data from the Alphavantage API.
